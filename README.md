# Bank Loan Approval Project üè¶

![ChatGPT Image Apr 19, 2025, 11_02_37 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/170fa5f6-498c-451f-8609-b429fb5ac777)

This project presents a complete **end-to-end data science pipeline** in a Jupyter Notebook to predict loan approval and repayment outcomes using a dataset of **45,000 records**.

From exploratory data analysis and classical machine learning to deep learning and reinforcement learning-driven pipeline optimization - this notebook explores the full lifecycle of modern applied machine learning on structured/tabular data.

## üîç Novel Approaches

This project introduces several novel ideas for ML automation:

### Reinforcement Learning for ML Pipeline Search
The entire ML pipeline - including preprocessing and hyperparameters - is treated as a **reinforcement learning environment**. A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent interacts with this space and learns to construct high-performing pipelines through trial and reward.

### Hybrid ML + DL Architecture
Using a custom `SklearnModelLayer`, a trained XGBoost model is wrapped inside a Keras neural network and treated as a learnable component. This enables real-time collaboration between tree-based and neural layers during inference.

## üß† Inspiration

This project is a small but powerful component of a broader intelligent AutoML system under development, aimed at **self-optimizing pipelines**, **RL-based configuration**, and **symbolic-neural integration** .. soon you'll hear about BrainsBuild AI. ;)
